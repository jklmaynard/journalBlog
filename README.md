This is a simple blog where a user can post a blog, write comments with full edit and delete functionality.

It is using a Bootstrap swatch, which you can find in the app/assets/stylesheets folder.

I concentrated most of the project on nailing down conceptually the paths that rails takes.  As I become more comfortable with it, I'm really impressed at its capabilities, although I look forward to how we can make partials work on the same page, more like Angular and Ember.

What this needs:

~ More spec coverage (I'm aware of that, Dustin.  I want to talk more about how I can write complete spec coverage)
~ Heroku functionality.
~ More styling!

All to be worked on, soon.
