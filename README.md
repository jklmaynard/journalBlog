To view:

In your web browser, go to the url localhost:3000.

This is a simple blog where a user can post a blog, write comments with full edit and delete functionality.

It is using a Bootstrap swatch, which you can find in the app/assets/stylesheets folder.

Still to deploy to heroku: the computer I'm writing on has permissions that I'm denied (given that it is being lent to me).  

License is of course MIT. Enjoy.
